# Bionics SciencesÂ® - Flip and Win
A web based 3x3 tile/card flipping game. The goal is to find the Star card in 3 tries.

The game was a promotional campaign for the teaser of a new coloured contact lense the company Bionics Sciences is launching. As of 7th July 2019, the lense has been launched and thus ending the game.

Here is a mockup of the visual and gameplay for try playing the game.

## Original Game Mechanics

The game runs on PHP and MySQL, where players have an account to keep track of the prizes won. 

The prizing has some rules:
- Each player can only win a prize, once a week
- Prizes are limited by grades, and refreshes weekly.
- If a player has gotten a higher grade prize for the week, he/she/they will not get another prize of said higher grade.

PHP is used to check if a player has won a prize, checking remaining prizes in stock for the week, and getting and recording should a player won a prize.

## Mockup Game Mechanics

This mockup game runs on JS instead, without the rules. So play away.
